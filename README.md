#First React Project

This static page project contains the setlist of Arctic Monkeys' 2022/2023 tour. 

I have been learning React from Scrimba's React course taught by Bob Ziroll. He is sucha wonderful teacher. This is a project based course that provides multiple challenges along the way. I have been enjoying it immensely.
The first project is a page with some facts about React, but I made something that was more personal to me (again). (Disclosure: My friend is a HUGE fan of Arctic Monkeys and we are going to see the concert. I love some of their music though.)

Deploying the site was definitely tricky as it was my first time working directly with NPM, but with help from a friend it is successfully deployed on Netlify which was taught on Scrimba.
